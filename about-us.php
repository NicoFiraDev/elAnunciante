          <p>We are professionals in Marketing and Graphic Design with over 30 years of experience.Today, year 2018 with more than 13 years of uninterrupted monthly circulation ElAnunciante FL.com has become the perfect tool that has united a diverse racial group mixedin a blessed country that has no alternative but to adopt their languages, foods, colors , music,religions and customs.<br><br>
            In 2001 we founded our first Hispanic publication in the United States, El Zocalo News inBattle Creek, Michigan. After its first year it was expanded to Indiana and Ohio as well<br><br>
            By 2006 we had also reached other states with publications such as Latino USA in Alabama,North Carolina, Kentucky, Tennessee, Kansas, and South Carolina.<br><br>
            Due to the rapid growth of the Hispanic population in the state of Florida, we chose tocontinue our project in the Central Florida.<br><br>
            Our first publication, El Anunciante, was released for Florida on October 2006.<br><br>
            On December 2009 our second publication, Latino USA Today, was released for Orlando.

        </div>
        <div class="px-4 text-justify">
          <p>After more than six years of experience working with Hispanics in several parts of the UnitedStates, we became more aware of the problem Hispanic businesses and especially newbusinesses faced when wanting to advertise. The high prices and rates of advertising in localnewspapers and magazines made it practically impossible to afford and promote theirbusinesses. In an effort to meet this need we developed a print medium with reasonableprices providing an affordable and effective way to introduce and expand products andservices in a competitive market.<br><br>
            Initially the publication was to be distributed only in places where the Hispanic communitygathered; but demographic changes, the intermingling of several cultures, and the"phenomenon of bilingualism", specifically in Central Florida, forced us to expand ourdistribution to places shared by both Hispanic and Anglo-American cultures.<br><br>
            Thus, El Anunciante was created as a monthly Hispanic publication of products and servicesas well as other information of general interest such as immigration, sports, health, nutrition,and entertainment.<br><br>
            Today and after more than 13 years in Central Florida, we are El Anunciante FL.compresented in a professional tabloid (10 "x 14") format, all its pages are designed in full colorand with excellent print quality. We pride ourselves in fulfilling our goal of being the mosteconomic choice with the greatest market coverage in Central Florida.
